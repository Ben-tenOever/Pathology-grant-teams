  "lab_synopsis": "Dr. Feske's research interests focus on investigating the role of ion channels and transporters, particularly calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, in the signaling pathways of immune cell function. His work includes studying how ion channel function influences immune cell responses to infectious diseases, exploring the contribution of calcium signals and ion channels to autoimmune diseases and potential therapeutic approaches, characterizing genetic and functional defects in ion channels that lead to primary immunodeficiency and immune system deficiencies, and understanding how ion channels contribute to immune responses against tumors and the mechanisms driving inflammatory processes. He has demonstrated that CRAC channels are essential for immunity to infection and antitumor immunity, while also showing they mediate autoimmunity in animal models. Beyond CRAC channels, his laboratory investigates which ion channels control immune responses in health and disease with the ultimate goal to identify drug targets for immunotherapy. The ICTI program he directs includes the Ion Laboratory (IonLab), a core facility providing electrophysiology support services to the research community at NYU Langone.",
