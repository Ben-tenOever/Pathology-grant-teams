    "lab_synopsis": "Our lab focuses on creating a novel cancer treatment platform using the oncolytic Sindbis viral vector (SV) engineered from Sindbis Virus. In the wild, Sindbis Virus is transmitted by mosquitoes among birds and mammals, which serve as amplifying hosts. Sindbis Virus is also transmitted to dead-end hosts such as humans where it sporadically causes mild cold-like symptoms although in most cases remains asymptomatic.  Our lab has developed SV that when systemically injected, targets and kills primary tumors as well as metastases in several in vivo mouse tumor models such as ovarian, colon, pancreatic and prostate cancer.  The use of SV for cancer treatment brings several advantages: (1) Sindbis has a positive sense single-stranded RNA, rendering the vector safer than DNA-based oncolytic viruses, as the vector cannot incorporate its genome into the host’s DNA. (2) Due to the fact that Sindbis is a blood-borne pathogen, it can be administrated systemically in the bloodstream from where it can spread throughout the body.  Today our research focuses in improving the efficacy of Sindbis vectors and studying its capability and mechanism of activating the immune response against different cancers.",

We build the tools to see it—from fixed-cell 3D FISH and dual-colour live CRISPR imaging to EpiMethylTag, MethNet, and cluster-based single-molecule nano-NOMe phasing—and apply them to show how drivers like NSD2 reprogram insulated domains and how DNA damage imprints lasting chromatin memory. Our earlier lymphocyte work established the playbook for locus contraction/decontraction, enhancer-guided proximity, recombination centers, and genome-stability checkpoints that still anchor our current cancer and immunity studies. Over two decades, the Skok lab has defined how 3D genome architecture, insulation by CTCF/cofactors, and enhancer logic orchestrate antigen-receptor recombination and lineage decisions, built experimental and computational tools to see these processes in living cells and single molecules, and translated these principles to cancer, neuro-oncology, immunology, and epigenetic disease, revealing domain-scale mechanisms and actionable vulnerabilities",

Our research program is focused on identifying metabolic alterations in cancer and the tumor microenvironment, focusing on triple-negative breast cancer and alterations in the metabolism of transformed and immune cells. My long-term goal is to understand the metabolic pathways that are altered in tumors, the processes that these altered pathways support, and the microenvironment, genetic, and epigenetic contexts in which these pathways are important. I have substantial experience and training in cancer genetics, tumor metabolism, and nutrient sensing pathways, and have authored manuscripts describing the contributions of mitochondrial metabolism, nucleotide synthesis, and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis to cancer and cell biology. A key to the success of this work has been generating new biological tools, enabling high-throughput screening in tumor-relevant environments and upon nutrient limitation. These projects provided me with experience mentoring graduate students and post-doctoral fellows who appear as co-authors on these publications, as well as collaborating with academic, industry, and clinical scientists. This work highlights our ability to establish a productive research program, producing impactful findings of importance to the tumor metabolism fields, and encouraging a collaborative and rigorous training program for the three graduate students and four post-doctoral fellows that comprise our group. I am pleased to support this R01 application to provide knowledge and experimental expertise on triple-negative breast cancer and metabolic alterations in normal and transformed cells.",

He has demonstrated that CRAC channels are essential for immunity to infection and antitumor immunity, while also showing they mediate autoimmunity in animal models. Beyond CRAC channels, his laboratory investigates which ion channels control immune responses in health and disease with the ultimate goal to identify drug targets for immunotherapy. The ICTI program he directs includes the Ion Laboratory (IonLab), a core facility providing electrophysiology support services to the research community at NYU Langone.",

We focus on how sister chromatid cohesion is established at repetitive sequences including telomeres, ribosomal DNA arrays, and centromeres in S phase during DNA replication and how these sequences are resolved and accurately distributed to daughter cells in mitosis. We study the role of the polyADP-ribosyltransferases tankyrase 1 and 2 in cohesion and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Our recent studies on cohesion showed that persistent telomere cohesion is due to RNA-DNA hybrid (R-loop) structures and further that their regulation by tankyrase impacts replicative senescence and cancer cell growth. For protein degradation, we identified multiple E3 ligases that ubiquitylate and control tankyrase function. We discovered a novel post-translational hybrid mark (ubiquitin on ADP-ribose on serine) and cognate hybrid readers that bind the hybrid mark to control ADP-ribosylation and stability of tankyrase and its targets.",
